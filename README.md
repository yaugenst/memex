# memex

Fast local history search for Claude, Codex CLI, Cursor, OpenCode, Pi, Oh My Pi, OpenClaw, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Grok. Also supports Hermes usage records. Uses BM-25 and optionally embeds your transcripts locally for hybrid search.

Mostly intended for agents to use via skill. The intended workflow is to ask agent about a previous session & then the agent can narrow things down & retrieve history as needed.

Includes a TUI for browsing, finding and resuming agent CLI sessions, with optional [token usage](#token-usage) tracking.

## Install
```bash
brew install nicosuave/tap/memex
```

Or

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicosuave/memex/main/scripts/setup.sh | sh
```

Or (from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/memex) on Arch Linux):

```bash
paru -S memex
```

Or (with [Nix](https://nixos.org/)):

```bash
nix run github:nicosuave/memex
```

<details>
<summary>Nix development and advanced configuration</summary>

**Development shell:**

```bash
nix develop
```

> **Note:** No binary cache is configured, so first builds compile from source.

**NixOS service:**

Enable background indexing with the provided module:

```nix
{
  inputs.memex.url = "github:nicosuave/memex";

  outputs = { nixpkgs, memex, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.default = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        memex.nixosModules.default
        {
          services.memex = {
            enable = true;
            continuous = true; # Run as a daemon (optional)
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

**Home Manager:**

Configure memex declaratively (generates `~/.memex/config.toml`):

```nix
{
  inputs.memex.url = "github:nicosuave/memex";

  outputs = { memex, ... }: {
    # Inside your Home Manager configuration
    modules = [
      memex.homeManagerModules.default
      {
        programs.memex = {
          enable = true;
          settings = {
            embeddings = true;
            include_reasoning = false;
            model = "minilm";
            execution_provider = "auto"; # coreml on macOS, cpu elsewhere
            cuda_device_id = 0; # optional when execution_provider = "cuda"
            cuda_library_paths = ["/usr/local/cuda/lib64"]; # optional override
            cudnn_library_paths = ["/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"]; # optional override
            compute_units = "ane"; # CoreML only: ane, gpu, cpu, all
            auto_index_on_search = true;
            token_usage = false; # opt in to local token and cost tracking
            index_service_interval = 3600;
          };
        };
      }
    ];
  };
}
```

</details>

Then install the shared skill used by Codex, OpenCode, Pi, and Oh My Pi:

```bash
memex skill install --target shared
```

The shared `memex-search` skill is installed once at
`~/.agents/skills/memex-search/SKILL.md` for Codex, OpenCode, Pi, and Oh My Pi.
For Claude Code, use `memex skill install --target claude`; its copy lives at
`~/.claude/skills/memex-search/SKILL.md`.

Use `memex skill status` to compare installed copies with the current Memex binary,
`memex skill update` after upgrading Memex, and `memex skill cleanup` to explicitly
remove obsolete paths left by older releases. Install never overwrites a differing file;
update only replaces copies that are already installed.

Restart Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, or Oh My Pi after installing or updating the skill.

## Quickstart

Index (incremental):
```
memex index
```

The default scan indexes Pi sessions from `~/.pi/agent/sessions` and Oh My Pi sessions
separately from `~/.omp/agent/sessions` plus named profile session directories.

Plaintext reasoning is excluded by default because it is usually low-value search noise. Opt
in with `memex index --include-reasoning`; reasoning records remain BM25-only. Encrypted and
redacted payloads, along with reasoning signature fields, are always excluded.

Search (JSONL default):
```
memex search "your query" --limit 20
```

TUI:
```
memex tui
```

Notes:
- Embeddings are disabled by default. Pass `--embeddings` to generate them during indexing.
- Searches run an incremental reindex by default (configurable).
- Index updates are copy-on-write generations. A writer builds a private generation and atomically
  publishes it when complete; searches keep using the previous immutable generation until then.
- Incremental indexing automatically removes records for paths that are confirmed missing beneath
  readable, enabled source roots. The lexical and analytics publication does not wait for a running
  embedding backfill: physical vector cleanup is deferred, and semantic search skips deleted vector
  IDs in the meantime. If embeddings are requested, the subsequent backfill waits for the embedding
  lease. Use `--no-prune` to suppress missing-path cleanup for a particular run.
- Concurrent searches coalesce stale auto-index work: one process refreshes while other lexical
  searches query the last committed index. Semantic and hybrid searches keep using the active
  complete vector generation while a replacement is built. Prune preview is read-only. Explicit
  mutations wait up to 30 seconds for the corresponding ingest or embedding lease and report its
  holder on timeout; lexical publication does not wait for an unrelated backfill.

Prune missing paths without rediscovering or rebuilding the corpus:
```
memex prune             # safe preview (same as --dry-run)
memex prune --apply     # prune lexical, analytics, vectors, and state; invalidate partial backfill
```

Apply preserves vectors for live records. If a resumable embedding backfill is in progress, its
checkpoint is discarded because its original corpus scope is no longer valid; the next backfill
resumes from the preserved active vector generation.

`memex reindex` is reserved for an intentionally clean rebuild, such as recovering from index
corruption or applying a schema-wide migration. Routine deletion and path cleanup do not require it.

Full transcript:
```
memex session <session_id>
```

Single record:
```
memex show <doc_id>
```

Human output:
```
memex search "your query" -v
```

## Multiple machines over SSH

Each machine keeps and updates its own index. The coordinating memex queries configured
machines concurrently over SSH, merges their rankings, and keeps the originating machine
attached to every result. The TUI uses the same backend for search, history previews,
sharing, token charts, and interactive resume.

Install a protocol-compatible memex binary on each machine and configure SSH normally in
`~/.ssh/config`. Then add machines to `~/.memex/config.toml`:

```toml
[multi_machine]
default = ["local", "mini"]
timeout_seconds = 10

[[machines]]
id = "mini"
label = "Mac mini"

[machines.control]
type = "ssh"
host = "mini" # SSH config alias

[machines.index]
type = "remote"
```

The `ssh = "mini"` field is a shorthand for the `machines.control` table. Set
`command = "/path/to/memex"` when `memex` is not on the non-interactive SSH `PATH`.
SSH keys, users, ports, jump hosts, and host-key policy remain in `~/.ssh/config`.

```sh
memex search "tantivy corruption"             # configured defaults
memex search "tantivy corruption" --machine mini
memex usage --machine local --machine mini
```

Unavailable machines produce partial results with a warning. Remote token usage requires
`token_usage = true` in that machine's memex config. The index backend is intentionally
separate from the control transport so an immutable S3 split backend can replace
`type = "remote"` later while SSH continues to handle indexing and resume.

In the TUI, use the `machines` dropdown (or press `m` while the session list is focused)
to select the configured default set, `local`, or one remote machine. The machine, source,
project, and query filters are shared by the session results and token chart; the range
dropdown bounds the chart.

### Opening federated results

Search results include the originating machine. Use it when opening a document or
session from another machine:

~~~sh
memex show 123 --machine mini
memex session SESSION_ID --machine mini --source-path /path/on/mini/session.jsonl
memex session SESSION_ID --machine mini --offset 500 --limit 500
~~~

Session pages are limited to 500 records. To fetch several sessions in one bounded
request, provide JSONL on stdin or as a file:

~~~json
{"machine":"mini","session_id":"SESSION_ID","source_path":"/path/on/mini/session.jsonl","offset":0,"limit":500}
~~~

~~~sh
memex hydrate requests.jsonl
cat requests.jsonl | memex hydrate
~~~

The batch input accepts at most 32 requests and returns one JSONL response per request,
including machine provenance, pagination metadata, and stable record_id values where
available.

## Token usage

Token tracking is disabled by default because it scans and caches local agent logs. Enable it in `~/.memex/config.toml`:

```toml
token_usage = true
```

Then reconstruct historical token usage from local Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Pi, Oh My Pi, OpenClaw, Copilot, Grok, and Hermes records:

```
memex usage
memex usage --source codex --since 2026-07-01
memex usage --source grok --since 2026-07-01
memex usage --source hermes --since 2026-07-01
memex usage --json --events
```

`--cost auto` prefers a provider-stored request cost and otherwise applies the versioned built-in API price catalog. `--cost source` uses only stored costs; `--cost reprice` always applies the catalog. Calculated costs are API-equivalent estimates, not subscription charges. Events with unknown models or prices remain in token totals and are reported as unpriced.

Each source also reports prompt-cache efficiency: the cache hit rate, plus an estimate of cache waste — prompt tokens that were in the previous request's prompt but were re-billed at input rates instead of read from cache, priced at catalog rates and attributed to idle gaps past the cache TTL or model switches where those apply. Waste is estimated per transcript file chain and errs toward undercounting: subagent sidechains, ambiguous dedupe deltas, and prompts that shrink past compaction are not counted.

Local token history is reconstructed usage. It is deliberately kept separate from authoritative subscription quota percentages and reset windows. Hermes usage is read from `state.db` in the Hermes root and immediate profile directories (`HERMES_PROFILE_ROOTS`, `HERMES_HOME`, or `HERMES_STATE_DIR`, with safe local defaults), opened read-only and WAL-compatible. The `sessions` aggregate is used for legacy databases; newer `session_model_usage` delta rows are emitted by model/task and reconciled against the session aggregate so historical seeded rows count once and positive residuals are retained. Snapshots, backups, arbitrary nested databases, JSON/JSONL transcripts, and auth, config, memory, skills, plugins, and cron paths are excluded. Hermes queries never read message, system-prompt, tool, reasoning-text, or credential tables. Usage output contains counters and metadata only. Any API-equivalent cost estimate is analytical and is not a Hermes subscription quota measurement; source-stored API costs are not quota percentages. Hermes parser-version changes invalidate only Hermes usage cache rows.

When token tracking is enabled, press `Ctrl+T` on the TUI home screen to toggle the 30-day activity chart between session count and token volume. Token activity is loaded lazily and cached when first shown.

## Build from source

```
cargo build --release
```

Linux with NVIDIA CUDA support:

```
cargo build --release --features cuda
```

Binary:
```
./target/release/memex
```

## Setup (manual)

If you built from source, install the skill embedded in that build:

```bash
memex skill install --target shared
```

Omit `--target` for an interactive menu of detected Claude/Codex/OpenCode/Pi/Oh My Pi installations.
## Search modes

| Need | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Exact terms | `search "exact term"` |
| Fuzzy concepts | `search "concept" --semantic` |
| Mixed | `search "term concept" --hybrid` |

## Common filters

- `--project <name>`
- `--role <user|assistant|tool_use|tool_result>`
- `--tool <tool_name>`
- `--session <session_id>`
- `--source claude|codex|cursor|opencode|pi|omp|openclaw|copilot|grok|hermes`
- `--since <iso|unix>` / `--until <iso|unix>`
- `--limit <n>`
- `--min-score <float>`
- `--sort score|ts`
- `--top-n-per-session <n>`
- `--unique-session`
- `--fields score,ts,doc_id,session_id,snippet`
- `--json-array`

JSON output also includes `source` and, when available, tree/linkage metadata:
`event_id`, `parent_event_id`, `logical_parent_event_id`,
`parent_session_id`, `thread_source`, `conversation_kind`,
`parent_tool_use_id`, `source_tool_use_id`, and
`source_tool_assistant_uuid`.

## Background index service

Works on macOS (launchd) and Linux (systemd).

Enable:
```
memex index-service enable
memex index-service enable --continuous
memex index-service enable --web-ui
```

Regenerate the service from current config and restart it:
```
memex index-service restart
```

Inspect the registered service and whether it is serving the Web UI:
```
memex index-service status
```

Open an authenticated browser session:
```
memex index-service open
```

Disable:
```
memex index-service disable
```

`index-service` reads config defaults (mode, interval, log paths). Flags override.

### Reclaiming obsolete index generations

After an upgrade, normal indexing automatically migrates a legacy index and removes obsolete
pre-lease generations. It preserves the committed Tantivy segments without rebuilding or reparsing
conversation history. No user action is required.

For diagnostics or to reclaim space immediately without waiting for the next index run, stop the
background service and close TUI/Web readers, then preview and run GC:

```bash
memex index-service disable
memex index-gc --dry-run
memex index-gc --offline
memex index-service enable --web-ui # or restore the mode you previously used
```

`index-gc` validates the committed index, hard-links only its live Tantivy segments into a clean
generation, atomically switches `CURRENT`, validates the document count again, and then removes
unreachable generations. It does not rebuild the index and does not rewrite live segment data.
The explicit command retains an `--offline` acknowledgement because it performs cleanup without a
normal index publication.

On Linux, creates systemd user units in `~/.config/systemd/user/`. On macOS, creates a launchd plist in `~/.memex/`.
On successful enable, memex writes `auto_index_on_search = false` to config when that setting is absent, so searches do not duplicate daemon work. Explicit user config is preserved.

`--web-ui` implies continuous mode and serves a local search and transcript browser at
`http://127.0.0.1:6363`. It mirrors the TUI's core workflow with search-as-you-type,
source and project filters, a persistent session list, and Matches/History transcript
previews. The server binds to loopback by default because the index
contains private conversation history. Memex refuses non-loopback HTTP listeners. If
remote access is required, use an authenticated TLS reverse proxy to `127.0.0.1` that
injects the installation bearer token into upstream requests. To use a different local port:

```
memex index-service enable --web-listen 127.0.0.1:8080
memex index-service open --listen 127.0.0.1:8080
```

The first Web UI start creates `~/.memex/web-auth-token` with mode `0600`. Private API
routes require that token as `Authorization: Bearer ...` or a browser session established
by `index-service open`. Browser links carry a signed, one-time credential in the URL
fragment, remove it before navigation continues, and exchange it for an ephemeral bearer
token held only in page memory. The browser token is never stored in a cookie,
`localStorage`, or session storage. Browser sessions expire after 12 hours, disappear when
the page closes, and are invalidated whenever the daemon restarts.

To run the same UI in the foreground without changing the background service:

```
memex web
```

Then run `memex index-service open` from another terminal.

The browser frontend lives in `web/`, uses React and shadcn components, and is
built with `cd web && bun install && bun run build`. The generated static assets
are embedded in the memex binary, so serving the UI does not add a JavaScript
runtime to the daemon.

## Embeddings

Enable during indexing:
```
memex index --embeddings
```

Build or resume semantic vectors for an existing lexical index:
```
memex embed
memex stats
```

Embedding batches are committed to `<root>/state/embed-backfill.sqlite3`. If the command or machine
stops, rerunning `memex embed` resumes from the last committed batch. The active complete vector
generation remains searchable throughout a model change or full backfill; memex publishes the new
generation atomically only after every live embeddable record is covered. `memex stats` reports
backfill progress and state while vector work exists.

Recommended when embeddings are on (especially non-`potion` models): run the background
index service or `index --watch`, and consider setting `auto_index_on_search = false`
to keep searches fast.

## Embedding model

Select via `--model` flag or `MEMEX_MODEL` env var:

| Model | Dims | Speed | Quality |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| minilm | 384 | Fastest | Good |
| bge | 384 | Fast | Better |
| nomic | 768 | Moderate | Good |
| gemma | 768 | Slowest | Best |
| potion | 256 | Fastest (tiny) | Lowest |

```
memex index --model minilm
# or
MEMEX_MODEL=minilm memex index
```

## Execution provider

Select via `execution_provider` in config or `MEMEX_EXECUTION_PROVIDER`:

| Provider | Platforms | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| auto | all | Default. Uses CoreML on macOS, CPU elsewhere |
| cpu | all | Force CPU execution |
| coreml | macOS | Uses CoreML; `compute_units` controls ane/gpu/cpu/all |
| cuda | Linux/NVIDIA | Requires a binary built with `--features cuda` and CUDA 12/cuDNN runtime libraries |

When `execution_provider = "cuda"`, you can optionally select a GPU with
`cuda_device_id` or `MEMEX_CUDA_DEVICE_ID`.

When loading CUDA, memex first tries the system loader paths, then any
configured `cuda_library_paths` / `cudnn_library_paths`, then common CUDA install
locations and active `venv` / `conda` `site-packages/nvidia/*/lib` directories.
If your system keeps CUDA or cuDNN in a nonstandard location, set
`MEMEX_CUDA_LIBRARY_PATHS` and `MEMEX_CUDNN_LIBRARY_PATHS` or the matching config
keys.

## Config (optional)

Create `~/.memex/config.toml` (or `<root>/config.toml` if you use `--root`):

```toml
embeddings = true
auto_index_on_search = true
include_reasoning = false  # opt in to plaintext reasoning; encrypted/redacted payloads stay excluded
token_usage = false  # opt in to local token and cost tracking
model = "minilm"  # minilm, bge, nomic, gemma, potion
execution_provider = "auto"  # auto, cpu, coreml, cuda
cuda_device_id = 0  # optional, when execution_provider = "cuda"
cuda_library_paths = ["/usr/local/cuda/lib64"]  # optional list of CUDA library dirs
cudnn_library_paths = ["/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"]  # optional list of cuDNN library dirs
compute_units = "ane"  # CoreML only: ane, gpu, cpu, all
scan_cache_ttl = 3600  # seconds (default 1 hour)
max_indexed_tool_input_bytes = 65536  # 64 KiB default
max_indexed_tool_output_bytes = 262144  # 256 KiB default
exclude_paths = ["~/.claude/projects/*-client-*", "~/work/**"]  # never index matched transcripts
index_service_mode = "interval"  # interval or continuous
index_service_interval = 3600  # seconds (ignored when mode = "continuous")
index_service_poll_interval = 30  # seconds
index_service_web_ui = false  # serve local browser; forces continuous mode when true
index_service_web_listen = "127.0.0.1:6363"
index_service_label = "memex-index"  # service name (default: com.memex.index on macOS)
index_service_systemd_dir = "~/.config/systemd/user"  # Linux only
claude_resume_cmd = "claude --resume {session_id}"
codex_resume_cmd = "codex resume {session_id}"
cursor_resume_cmd = "cursor-agent --resume {session_id}"
opencode_resume_cmd = "opencode resume {session_id}"
pi_resume_cmd = "pi --session {source_path_shell}"
# copilot_resume_cmd = "your-copilot-resume-command {session_id}"
grok_resume_cmd = "cd {cwd_shell} && grok --resume {session_id}"
herdr_resume = "tab"  # inside a herdr pane: "tab" (default), "split", or "off"
```

Service logs and the plist live under `~/.memex` by default (macOS). On Linux, systemd units are created in `~/.config/systemd/user/`.

`scan_cache_ttl` controls how long auto-indexing considers scans fresh.
`include_reasoning` defaults to false. Set it to true (or pass `memex index
--include-reasoning`) to add plaintext reasoning as BM25-only records. Encrypted
and redacted reasoning payloads are always excluded.
`max_indexed_tool_*_bytes` limits oversized tool payloads while leaving user and assistant text
unchanged. memex keeps roughly the first three quarters and final quarter, with a marker reporting
the omitted middle. Each value must be at least 1024 bytes. Run `memex index --reindex` to apply
new limits to records that are already indexed.
`exclude_paths` takes glob patterns matched against transcript source paths at index time, so
matched transcripts never enter the index (a leading `~/` is expanded to your home directory).
Adding a pattern also removes records previously indexed from matched paths — no `--reindex`
required. For one-off runs, pass `--exclude GLOB` (repeatable) to `memex index`.
`execution_provider` applies to ONNX-backed models; `potion` uses the model2vec backend.
`cuda_library_paths` and `cudnn_library_paths` accept path lists and are only used
when `execution_provider = "cuda"`.

Resume command templates accept `{session_id}`, `{project}`, `{source}`, `{source_path}`, `{source_dir}`, `{cwd}`, plus shell-quoted `{source_path_shell}`, `{source_dir_shell}`, and `{cwd_shell}`.

The skill definitions are bundled in `skills/`.

## herdr plugin

This repo is also a herdr plugin: it turns the memex TUI into a herdr-native session desk. Browse
and search every past agent session from a herdr pane, then resume one into a new herdr tab.

```bash
herdr plugin install nicosuave/memex
```

Or from a checkout:

```bash
cargo build --release
herdr plugin link .
```

`install` reuses a `memex` already on your PATH when it is current, otherwise it downloads the
release build matching the plugin version. `link` uses `target/release/memex` from the checkout.

| Action | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `memex: session palette` | Recent sessions as an overlay: Enter resumes into a new tab, quitting returns focus where it was |
| `memex: recent sessions here` | The palette pre-filtered to the focused workspace's repo |
| `memex: session desk` | Opens the TUI zoomed over the focused pane |
| `memex: toggle sidebar` | Opens the TUI as a split beside your work, or closes it |
| `memex: resume last session` | Resumes the most recent session for the focused pane's directory, without opening the TUI |
| `memex: refresh index` | Runs an incremental `memex index` now |
| `memex: open web UI` | Starts `memex web` if nothing is listening, then opens it in the browser |

Resuming inside herdr opens the session in a new herdr tab rather than taking over the current
pane, so the desk stays where it is and you can resume several sessions in a row. Set
`herdr_resume = "split"` (or `"off"`) in memex's own `config.toml` to change that. Each herdr
session start also kicks off a background incremental index.

The plugin is backed by two new CLI surfaces that work anywhere:

```bash
memex sessions --cwd . --limit 5     # JSONL: session_id, cwd, git_root, resume_cmd, ...
memex herdr resume-last --cwd .      # resume the newest session for this repo into a herdr tab
```

Plugin config lives at `config.toml` in the plugin's herdr config directory and is re-read on
every action:

```toml
toggle_placement = "split"     # split, overlay, zoomed, tab
toggle_direction = "right"     # right, down
index_on_startup = true        # background index at herdr session start
web_listen = "127.0.0.1:6363"
```

Bind the desk to a key in your herdr config:

```toml
[[keys.command]]
key = "cmd+m"
type = "plugin_action"
command = "nicosuave.memex.palette"
description = "memex session palette"
```

The plugin is listed in the herdr marketplace through the `herdr-plugin` GitHub topic on this
repo.
