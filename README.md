# memex

Search, browse, and revisit your local agent history. Memex indexes conversations
from coding tools so you and your agents can find previous work, read the original
transcripts, and resume sessions in their original tool where supported.

Keyword search uses BM25. Optional local embeddings add semantic and hybrid search.
You can also search saved Claude and Codex memories, query history across machines
over SSH, and track token usage from local logs.

## Install

```bash
brew install nicosuave/tap/memex
```

Or use the installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicosuave/memex/main/scripts/setup.sh | sh
```

See [installation and updates](docs/installation.md) for Arch Linux, Nix, Cargo,
source builds, and upgrade behavior.

## Quickstart

```bash
memex index                              # Index local agent history
memex                                    # Browse sessions in the terminal
memex search "deployment rollback" --format text
memex session SESSION_ID                 # Read a transcript page
```

In the TUI, select a session to read it or use its resume action to continue in the
original agent. Resume requires that agent to be installed and its session data to
remain available. See the [engine support table](#engine-support) for exceptions.

Indexing discovers supported sources automatically. To select specific engines:

```bash
memex index --only-source claude --only-source codex
memex search "deployment rollback" --source codex --project my-project
```

Search defaults to conversations and JSONL output. Embeddings, plaintext reasoning,
and token tracking are off by default. Searches refresh stale indexes automatically;
for background indexing, run `memex daemon enable --continuous`.

## Engine support

Support varies by capability. **History** means indexing, searching, and reading
locally available conversations. **Resume** opens an existing session in its original
tool. **Import into** creates a conversation in another tool using the
[experimental transfer feature](#experimental-session-transfers).

| Engine | History | Token usage | Resume | Saved memories | Import into |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Experimental |
| Codex | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Experimental |
| Cursor | Yes | Yes | CLI sessions | No | Experimental |
| OpenCode | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Experimental |
| Pi | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Experimental |
| Oh My Pi | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| OpenClaw | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Experimental |
| Grok | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Jcode | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Muse | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Antigravity | Yes | No | Yes | No | No |
| IBM Bob | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| ZCode | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| Hermes | No | Yes | No | No | No |

- **History coverage depends on the local records a tool saves.** Cursor history
  comes from agent transcripts; its usage data comes from local databases.
  Antigravity reads available transcript, SQLite, and overview projections; it
  does not decrypt encrypted trajectories. Its token counters are not yet supported.
  ZCode reads `~/.zcode/cli/db/db.sqlite`, which its SSH-attached runtimes also
  write on remote hosts; `ZCODE_HOME` (comma-separated) indexes extra stores.
- **Token usage is opt-in and depends on recorded counters.** Cost estimates are
  not subscription charges or quota balances. Hermes support reads usage counters
  and metadata only, not message content. Copilot usage requires local OpenTelemetry
  export files; session transcripts alone do not supply its usage data.
- **Resume uses per-engine commands**, configurable in Memex. Cursor uses
  `cursor-agent`; Antigravity uses `agy` or `antigravity`. A supported command does
  not guarantee every historical session remains resumable in newer tool versions.
- **Saved memories are separate from transcripts.** Only Claude project memories
  and Codex memory files are discovered. Search them with `--content memories`, or
  combine them with conversations using `--content all`.

See [source discovery and memory retrieval](docs/search.md) and
[usage details](docs/usage.md) for formats, paths, and limitations.

## Ways to use Memex

| Interface | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| CLI | Search, bounded transcript reads, indexing, usage reports, and scripts |
| TUI | Browse, search, preview, and resume sessions; view activity |
| Web UI | Browse and search from a local authenticated browser |
| [macOS app](apps/macos/README.md) | Native project and session browsing, lexical search, and local resume |
| [Qt app](apps/qt/README.md) | Native desktop browsing, lexical search, and conversation reading |
| [MCP server](docs/mcp.md) | Give agents structured search and transcript retrieval tools |
| [Search skill](#agent-integration) | Teach agents to use the Memex CLI for source-backed recall |
| [herdr plugin](docs/herdr.md) | Browse and resume sessions from a herdr pane |

The interfaces share Memex's data, but expose different workflows. The native app
READMEs describe their capabilities and platform requirements.

For the macOS app:

```bash
brew install nicosuave/tap/memex-app
```

The [native macOS app](apps/macos/README.md):

<img width="1876" height="1146" alt="Memex native macOS app" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e112c96-5b1c-4de3-80bc-c06939dac18a" />

The [Qt companion](apps/qt/README.md):

<img width="1178" height="768" alt="Memex Qt companion" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1de09c11-e432-4613-9928-a32b39be204a" />

For the browser:

```bash
memex web serve
```

To keep indexing and the browser running in the background:

```bash
memex daemon enable --web-ui
memex web open
```

See [background indexing and Web UI authentication](docs/daemon.md).

## Search and read

```bash
memex search "migration failure" --format text
memex search "migration failure" --source claude --limit 10
memex search "deployment decision" --content all
memex search "project conventions" --content memories
memex sessions --cwd . --limit 5
memex session SESSION_ID
memex show --record-id RECORD_ID --machine local
```

Search results identify the session, source, and machine so you can retrieve the
original records. Transcript reads are bounded by default and return continuation
information for longer content.

For semantic or hybrid search, first generate local embeddings:

```bash
memex index --embeddings
memex search "how we handled retries" --mode hybrid --format text
```

See [search and reading](docs/search.md) for filters, output formats, pagination,
reasoning inclusion, and memory retrieval; see [embeddings and configuration](docs/configuration.md)
for models and CPU, CoreML, or CUDA execution.

## Agent integration

Install the shared search skill for Codex, OpenCode, Pi, and Oh My Pi:

```bash
memex skill install --target shared
```

For Claude Code:

```bash
memex skill install --target claude
```

Restart the agent after installing or updating its skill. The skill guides it to
search progressively and verify relevant source records.

For MCP clients that launch a local process:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memex": { "command": "memex", "args": ["mcp", "--transport", "stdio"] }
  }
}
```

Memex also serves authenticated Streamable HTTP with `memex mcp`, or alongside
background indexing with `memex daemon enable --mcp`. See the [MCP guide](docs/mcp.md)
for client setup, OAuth, remote access, and the retrieval tool contracts.

## Multiple machines over SSH

Each machine keeps its own index. Memex queries configured machines over SSH and
returns results with their originating machine attached. Unavailable machines
produce partial results with a warning.

```bash
memex search "deployment rollback" --machine mini
memex session SESSION_ID --machine mini
```

Install Memex on each machine and add its SSH configuration to
`~/.memex/config.toml`. See [multiple-machine setup](docs/machines.md) for a complete
example and remote reading and resume behavior.

## Token usage

Enable local usage tracking in `~/.memex/config.toml`:

```toml
token_usage = true
```

```bash
memex usage
memex usage --source codex --since 2026-09-01
```

Usage is reconstructed from each engine's local records. Costs prefer recorded
request prices and otherwise use a built-in price catalog; calculated values are
API-equivalent estimates, not subscription charges. Missing prices remain visibly
unpriced. See [usage and cost estimates](docs/usage.md) for details.

## Experimental session transfers

`memex transfer` imports an indexed conversation into Codex, Claude Code, Copilot
CLI, Cursor, OpenCode, or Pi. This is **experimental**, and compatibility depends on
the destination tool's version and storage format.

Transfers reconstruct conversation content; they do not migrate the complete
agent runtime, workspace files, permissions, or executable tool state. Use native
resume when you want to continue the original session in the same tool.

```bash
# Generate an intermediate transcript without importing into the destination
memex transfer SESSION_ID --source claude --to codex --dry-run

# Import the conversation into the destination tool
memex transfer SESSION_ID --source claude --to codex
```

- `--mode compact` (default) imports cleaned user and assistant text.
- `--mode strict` also includes tool activity **as text notes**. It does not provide
  a lossless native-session migration.
- `--turns N` limits the history included. Pi defaults to the last 60 user turns
  and caps imports at 400.
- `--source` disambiguates session IDs present in more than one engine.

The command reads the local Memex index. A dry run still writes a generated
transcript file, but does not import it into the target. A successful import prints
the destination information and a resume command; it does not validate that the
destination can reproduce the original session's behavior.

## Personal fork

This branch retains resumable embedding backfill, independently supervised daemon
embedding work, confirmed-missing-file pruning (`--no-prune` to retain history),
and federated CLI session listing. `memex sessions` uses configured machines;
repeat `--machine` to select peers. MCP session discovery remains local.

```sh
memex index stats
memex sessions --machine local --machine superbaozidora --limit 20
```

Upgrading the lexical index format requires preserving and remapping existing
embeddings before rebuilding. Do not run `memex index rebuild` on the old data
root as a migration: it deletes the vector and memory indexes too.
