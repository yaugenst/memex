# Event-driven indexing: FSEvents / inotify spec

> **Implementation status (shipped):** `src/watch.rs` + daemon wiring
> implements this spec with `--watch-mode events|poll` (`daemon run`,
> `daemon enable/restart`, hidden on legacy `index --watch`).
> Two findings from implementation are now part of the design:
> (1) FSEvents defers content-modification events for files held open for
> writing (0 events in 8s with the fd open, immediate delivery on close;
> regression test `fsevents_defers_modify_until_close`) while agents stream
> transcripts through a single held-open fd (confirmed via `lsof` on live
> Codex sessions) — so macOS runs a 5s hot sweep re-statting recently
> active files (`hot_sweep_dirty`, `HOT_SWEEP_INTERVAL`, `HOT_WINDOW`).
> Candidates are selected from stored ingest timestamps before statting;
> cold sessions resume through events or the periodic resync. Tracked
> OpenCode databases also have their main file and WAL statted, since an
> open WAL can contain commits without any main-file modification.
> inotify reports every write, so Linux skips the sweep.
> (2) Watch roots are canonicalized before arming: backends silently
> mis-deliver for paths containing symlinks.
> Dirty batches now call `ingest_dirty`: `src/ingest/selection.rs` resolves
> ordinary transcript paths without walking source trees, and publication
> reuses the existing parsers, lease, writer, analytics, and ingest state.
> OpenCode WAL updates with unchanged session ownership scan only their DB.
> Structural changes and unresolved dependencies use full reconciliation
> (see §7). Partial runs never advance the full-scan cache or resync timer.

Started from latest `main` (`04adaca`). This spec replaces the daemon's
polling loop with OS filesystem events, with periodic reconciliation as the
correctness backstop. Events are **hints only** — `ingest.json` file-state
stays the source of truth.

## 1. Problem

`run_index_loop` (`src/cli.rs:1756`) sleeps `poll_interval` (default 30s,
`src/config.rs:424`) then calls `run_index_args` → `ingest_all`
(`src/ingest.rs:668`), which walks **every** source root, stats every file,
and diffs against `IngestState` (`src/state.rs:122`).

Costs:

- Worst-case ~30s index latency for an active agent session.
- A full walk + stat storm every 30s even when idle (battery, SSD, CPU).
- Walk cost grows with history size; parse cost is already incremental via
  `offset`/`turn_id`, but discovery is not.
- Lease contention with search-time `ingest_if_stale` (`src/ingest.rs:543`)
  and TUI auto-index (`src/tui.rs:1118`): the daemon wakes up just to find
  nothing changed and fight for the lease.

Goal: index a changed transcript in ~1–3s of settle time, do ~zero work when
idle, and never miss/duplicate records even when events are lost, coalesced,
or reordered.

Non-goals: changing the record format, the Tantivy writer protocol, the
`PendingIngest` crash-recovery protocol, or the vector/analytics pipelines.
Those are reused untouched.

## 2. Platform answer: yes, Linux has an equivalent — use `notify`, not raw APIs

| OS    | Native API              | Properties |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| macOS | FSEventStream (FSEvents) | Device-scoped, path-scoped stream, coalesced, persistent `since` event ID, directory-granularity history, `mustScanSubDirs` resync flag, latency parameter. Misses nothing unless the stream overflows, but tells you only *something under this dir changed*. |
| Linux | inotify                 | Per-watch-descriptor, **non-recursive**, fixed-size kernel queue. Reports file-granular create/modify/delete/move cookies, but drops events with `IN_Q_OVERFLOW` under load and requires the watcher to manage recursive watches itself (watch new subdirs on create, drop watches on delete/move, watch parents of not-yet-existing roots). |

Do **not** hand-roll `fsevents-sys` on macOS plus `inotify` on Linux.
Depend on the `notify` crate (`RecommendedWatcher`): FSEvents backend on
macOS, inotify backend on Linux, correct recursive-watch management included,
single API for both. This is the standard choice and the only way to keep the
two platforms' wildly different semantics behind one tested abstraction.
(`notify-debouncer-mini` or `notify-debouncer-full` supplies the coalescing
layer; prefer `debouncer-mini` — smaller, fewer surprises — unless the
`full` variant's rename-cookie tracking proves necessary in testing.)

Windows (`ReadDirectoryChangesW`) comes free via `notify` but is out of scope
for testing; the code must compile there, nothing more.

## 3. Requirements

### Functional

- R1. Daemon indexes appended/created transcripts within seconds, without any
  polling sleep in the hot path.
- R2. All currently polled sources are covered (section 5). Adding a source
  later means adding its roots in one place.
- R3. CLI/config stays backward compatible: `--watch` / `--watch-interval` /
  `--poll-interval` / `index_service_poll_interval` keep working, reinterpreted
  as event mode + resync interval (section 9).

### Correctness (no ghetto)

- C1. Events never advance trust directly. Every event path is re-`stat`ed and
  run through the existing `prepare_file_task` comparison (`src/ingest.rs:191`:
  size, mtime, `FileIdentity` device/inode/prefix-hash/modified-ns,
  parser-version). An event for an unchanged file is a no-op.
- C2. Full reconciliation always converges: startup scan, periodic resync,
  overflow resync, error resync, and delete/rename tombstone sweep (section 8).
  A daemon that missed *every* event still converges on the next resync.
- C3. No torn-read corruption: a file actively being appended is only parsed
  after settle (section 7). A partial trailing JSONL line must never advance
  `offset` past committed data — verify the parsers already skip/retain it;
  if any parser advances on error, fix that first.
- C4. No duplicate records on rename/rotation/truncation: reuse the exact
  `delete_first` paths (`size < previous.size`, mtime regression,
  `file_was_replaced`, parser-version change, Jcode atomic-reparse rule).
- C5. Crash safety preserved: the `PendingIngest` write-ahead marker
  (`src/state.rs:141`, `src/ingest.rs:1452`) and `prepare_pending_ingest_recovery`
  flow stay exactly as-is. Event mode must not clear/skip recovery.
- C6. Single-flight ingest under the existing `IngestLease` (`src/lease.rs`).
  Never run two ingests concurrently; never bypass the lease because "events
  are fast".

### Performance

- P1. Idle daemon does no walks, no stats, no wakeups except the resync timer.
- P2. A one-line append to one file stats ~1 file and parses the tail — never
  a full walk.
- P3. Bursty agent output (dozens of appends/second) coalesces into at most ~1
  ingest per debounce window per batch.
- P4. Dirty-set memory is bounded; overload degrades to "full resync needed",
  never to unbounded queues or OOM.
- P5. Embedding/vector work batching (`EMBED_BATCH_SIZE`, writer thread in
  `ingest_all`) is unchanged; event mode must not lower the batching that
  makes bulk ingest efficient.

## 4. Architecture

New `src/watch.rs` (name TBD, ~600–900 lines + tests), wired into the daemon
only:

```
OS events (notify) ──> filter ──> debounce/settle ──> dirty set ──> scheduler ──> ingest
                              │                                              │
                              └── resync timer / overflow / error ────────────┘
```

- **Root resolver**: pure function `watch_roots(options: &IngestOptions, config) -> Vec<PathBuf>`
  computed from the same inputs as `ingest_all` discovery. Canonicalizes,
  dedups, drops disabled sources, keeps not-yet-existing roots as "pending"
  (watch nearest existing ancestor).
- **Watcher**: one `RecommendedWatcher` held for the daemon lifetime.
  Recursive watches where supported; on Linux `notify` manages subdir watches.
- **Pipeline**: synchronous filter → debouncer → dirty-set insert. The ingest
  trigger fires on: debounce quiet-period expiry, max-batch-age expiry, or
  resync timer/overflow/error.
- **Scheduler**: single-flight. Holds `IngestLease` via `try_acquire`; on
  contention keeps the dirty set and retries with backoff instead of dropping.
  Runs the ingest on a dedicated thread so the watcher callback never blocks.
- **Ingest**: two tiers (section 7). Both tiers funnel into the existing
  `prepare_file_task` → parse → `writer_loop` machinery. No forked parse logic.

`memex daemon run` / `memex index --watch` construct this instead of
`run_index_loop`'s `sleep` loop. One-shot `memex index`, `search` auto-index,
TUI auto-index, RPC, MCP paths are untouched except that they benefit from
fresher state.

## 5. Watch roots (must all be covered)

Resolver output derives from the enabled-source flags in `IngestOptions`:

| Source | Roots to watch | Notes |
| ------ | -------------- | ----- |
| Claude | `default_claude_sources()` (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or `~/.claude/projects`, `~/.config/claude/projects`) + explicit `--claude-path` | Watch the `projects` dirs, not `$HOME`. |
| Codex | `CODEX_HOME` (`~/.codex`): `sessions/`, rollout roots, history file parents | History files are single files — watch parent dir. |
| OpenCode | `OPENCODE_DATA_DIR` / `~/.local/share/opencode`: storage root, message/parts roots, `opencode*.db` parents | Route WAL events to their main DB path: committed writes may change only the WAL. Ignore `-shm`/`-journal` noise. Cursor logic (`event_rowid`/`event_id` in `scan_database`) stays authoritative. |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/projects` | |
| Pi | `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` / `~/.pi/agent/sessions` (+ configured session root) | Env-driven; also watch `config.toml` (see below) and re-resolve roots when it changes. |
| OMP | `~/.omp/agent/sessions`, profiles root, `XDG_DATA_HOME` variant | |
| OpenClaw | `~/.openclaw`, `~/.clawdbot` state dirs | |
| Copilot | `COPILOT_HOME` / `~/.copilot` session root | |
| Grok | `GROK_HOME` / `~/.grok/sessions` | |
| Jcode | `JCODE_HOME` / `~/.jcode/sessions` | Single-JSON files: atomic reparse rule already exists; event just triggers it sooner. |
| Muse | `MUSE_HOME` / `~/.local/share/muse/sessions` | |
| Hermes | `HERMES_HOME` profiles | Currently discovery-only; include for free via `profile_roots()`. |
| Memory docs | Inputs live in project memory directories, not just Memex's outputs. Refresh during full ingestion/reconciliation and the existing search-time refresh path; targeted transcript batches do not rediscover memory inputs. Memory documents are not independently watched in v1. |
| Config | `~/.memex/config.toml` | Change → re-resolve roots (add/drop watches), re-read debounce/resync settings. Debounce this harder (5s); never trigger an ingest by itself. |

Nonexistent roots: watch the nearest existing ancestor so first-run creation is
observed, then escalate to the real root once it appears. Never `watch("/")`
or `$HOME` as a fallback — too broad, too many events, violates P1.

## 6. Event filtering (before debounce)

Drop in the watcher callback, in order:

1. Non-regular files: directories themselves (except create/delete, which mean
   "re-discover the subtree"), symlinks followed sideways (discovery uses
   `follow_links(false)` — the watcher must match that), sockets/fifos.
2. Sidecars and temp files: `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `*~`, `.DS_Store`,
   `.memex-opencode-spool-*` (`OPENCODE_SPOOL_PREFIX`), Tantivy generation
   workdirs under `~/.memex/index` (never watch `~/.memex` itself), SQLite
   `-shm`/`-journal` and unrelated `-wal` files. OpenCode WAL events are
   translated into main-DB hints before filtering the remaining sidecars.
3. Paths matching the existing `PathExcluder` (config `exclude_paths` + CLI
   `--exclude`). Canonicalize before matching, exactly like discovery does.
4. Events from our own state writes (`ingest.json`, `scan_cache.json`,
   `ingest.pending.json`) — these live under `~/.memex/state`, which is not a
   watch root, so this is defense-in-depth; assert it in a test.

What survives: create/modify/rename affecting `*.jsonl`, `*.json`, codex
history files, opencode `*.sqlite` main files, cursor/grok/copilot session
files. When in doubt, keep the event — `prepare_file_task` will no-op it
cheaply (one stat). Over-filtering causes silent misses; under-filtering costs
one stat.

## 7. Debounce, settle, batch, schedule

- **Per-path debounce**: 1–2s quiet period (configurable, default 1.5s).
  Streaming agents append many lines/second; each append resets the path timer.
- **Max batch age**: 5–10s. A continuously-appended file still gets indexed at
  least every max-age even without a quiet period.
- **Global batch window**: collect all settled paths; fire one ingest covering
  the whole dirty set. Minimum ingest spacing ~2s (prevents ingest thrash when
  5 agents write concurrently).
- **Settle check at fire time**: re-stat each dirty path; require size+mtime
  stable across the debounce window (two consecutive stats agree) *or* the
  quiet period fully elapsed with no new event. If still churning, keep it in
  the dirty set for the next batch — do not parse a file that grew in the last
  ~500ms. This plus the trailing-line rule (C3) eliminates torn reads.
- **Opencode SQLite**: extra settle — after the DB file settles, still
  `scan_database` from the stored cursor; if the DB is mid-checkpoint/locked,
  treat like the existing `Err(_) → files_skipped` path and retry next batch,
  not as fatal.
- **Backpressure**: dirty set capped (e.g. 10k paths). Overflow → set
  `full_resync_needed = true` and clear per-path detail. Queue depth and
  coalesced-event counters go to logs/metrics, not to unbounded memory.

### Ingest tiers

- **Tier 1 — dirty fast path** (hot path): for each dirty path, stat + build
  `FileTask` via the existing `prepare_file_task` with prior `FileState`.
  Skip unchanged (same size+mtime fast path already inside). Parse tails in the
  existing rayon pool, publish through the existing `writer_loop`. No directory
  walk. This is the whole performance win.
- **Dependency/structural fallback**: directory changes, missing indexed
  paths, ambiguous source overlaps and nested symlinks request full
  reconciliation. So do legacy OpenCode message/part/session dependencies,
  Pi settings, Grok summaries and Copilot workspace metadata. New ordinary
  transcript files use Tier 1. Unrelated regular files and agent-home cache
  directories are ignored. Source-scoped structural discovery is future work.
- **Tier 3 — full resync** (section 8): literally call the existing
  `ingest_all` discovery path. Correctness backstop, not the hot path.

`ingest_all` and `ingest_dirty` share `ingest_selected` and its publication
pipeline. Targeted Codex history uses known rollout paths plus the current
batch for deduplication. Partial inventories preserve unselected file and
database state and cannot establish absence of another database.

## 8. Reconciliation protocol (the correctness core)

Events are lossy on both platforms (coalescing, overflow, watcher gaps during
sleep/restart, missed subdir watches, rename half-reports). The design treats
every trigger below as funneling into Tier 3 unless the dirty set precisely
covers it:

1. **Startup**: always Tier 3 full scan before arming the watcher snapshot.
   Also runs `PendingIngest` recovery first (unchanged order). This bounds
   the offline window (daemon stopped, laptop asleep, `kill -9`).
2. **Periodic resync**: Tier 3 after the configured interval since the last
   complete scan (default 600s; legacy poll-interval settings remain honored).
   Targeted ingestion never postpones this deadline or updates the full-scan
   cache, so continuous activity cannot starve missed-event recovery.
3. **Overflow/resync signals**: FSEvent `mustScanSubDirs` / history-drop, inotify
   `IN_Q_OVERFLOW`, `notify::EventKind::Other` resync markers, watcher `Error`
   of any kind → immediate Tier 3, then re-establish watches. Log at warn with
   the platform flag that caused it.
4. **Watch-gap detection**: watcher thread death, sleep/wake (detect via clock
   jump > resync interval or OS power notifications if cheap; clock jump alone
   suffices for v1), config-root change → Tier 3 + root re-resolution.
5. **Tombstone sweep**: deletes/renames may report only the old path (or only
   a dir event). Tier 2's per-root discovery diff against `state.files` finds
   vanished keys; vanished keys go through the existing `delete_paths` purge
   on both Tantivy and vector stores. Additionally, Tier 3's existing
   excluded/vanished handling stays as the final sweep. Never trust a delete
   event alone to name every affected session (directory renames move many).
6. **Opencode ownership drift**: ordinary WAL updates retain the existing
   owned-session set and update only that database. A new database or changed
   session set escalates to full discovery before publication, so ownership
   transfers and legacy-store migration use the complete claim pass.
7. **State-vs-index audit**: keep the `empty_index_rebuild` guard
   (`src/ingest.rs:687`) and the `PendingIngest` source-path invalidation on
   all tiers. If the index is empty but state is non-empty (or vice versa),
   Tier 3 rebuilds — events never paper over store divergence.

Invariant to assert in tests: **event-driven converge == poll converge**.
Given the same fixture mutation sequence, applying events-then-resync must
produce byte-identical `ingest.json` (modulo timestamps) and identical record
counts as a full `ingest_all`. Any divergence is a P0 bug in Tier 1/2 scoping,
not an acceptable approximation.

## 9. Config, CLI, and service integration

- New `UserConfig` keys (all optional, all with the defaults below):
  `index_service_watch_mode = "events" | "poll" | "hybrid"` (default `hybrid`
  at rollout, `events` after soak), `index_service_watch_debounce_ms` (1500),
  `index_service_watch_max_batch_ms` (8000), `index_service_resync_interval`
  (600; alias: existing `index_service_poll_interval` when the new key is
  unset, so current 30s configs become a 30s resync floor rather than breaking).
- CLI: `daemon run` gains `--watch-mode`, `--watch-debounce-ms`,
  `--resync-interval`; `--poll-interval` stays as an alias for the resync
  floor. Hidden legacy `index --watch/--watch-interval` maps to
  `watch_mode=events-or-hybrid` + resync floor for compat with installed
  launchd/systemd units (`build_index_command_args`, `src/cli.rs:6041` must
  emit the new flags for newly generated units; old units with `--watch` keep
  working).
- launchd (`KeepAlive`, `src/cli.rs:6148`) and systemd (`Type=simple`,
  `Restart=always`, `src/cli.rs:6285`) need **no** structural change — the
  daemon is already long-lived in continuous mode. Interval-mode units
  (`StartInterval` / `.timer`) are unaffected and stay poll-based.
- Shutdown: SIGTERM/SIGINT stops the watcher, flushes the dirty set with a
  short grace ingest (bounded, e.g. 5s), then exits. No event may be recorded
  as "handled" before its ingest commits and `ingest.json` saves.

## 10. Observability

Structured log lines (existing conventions) for: watcher start/stop, roots
added/dropped, events received/coalesced/filtered, debounce fires, dirty-set
size, tier chosen, ingest outcome (`records_added`, `files_scanned/skipped`
— same fields as today), resync cause (`startup`/`timer`/`overflow`/`error`/
`clock-jump`/`config-change`), lease-contention skips. Expose counters for a
future `daemon status`: `events_total`, `events_coalesced`, `ingests`,
`full_resyncs_by_cause`, `lease_skips`, `watch_errors`. A silent watcher is the
failure mode — if `events_total` stays 0 across two resync intervals while
resyncs find changes, log at warn (likely broken watch, e.g. wrong root).

## 11. Testing and acceptance

- Unit: filter table (sidecars/temps/excludes), debounce coalescing (100 rapid
  events → 1 ingest), backpressure overflow → resync flag, root re-resolution
  on config change, canonicalization matching `PathExcluder`.
- Integration (per source, macOS + Linux CI): append burst → eventually indexed
  with exact record counts; create → picked up without full walk (assert via
  walk counter or timing); rotate/truncate/same-size-rewrite → `delete_first`
  reparse, no duplicates; rename dir with N sessions → all N converge;
  delete → tombstone purge from index+vectors; torn write (append partial line,
  hold 200ms, complete) → no error, no offset skip; `kill -9` mid-ingest →
  restart converges via `PendingIngest` + startup scan.
- Opencode: dirty-session scan after DB append; locked-DB retry; ownership move
  between DBs converges.
- Soak: `fuzzer` appending/rotating across sources for X minutes; assert
  converge-equality with `ingest_all` (section 8 invariant) and zero record-id
  duplication.
- Resync proofs: synthesize overflow (fill inotify queue / set tiny
  buffer in test) → Tier 3 fires; stop watcher 60s, mutate, restart → startup
  scan converges.
- Perf: idle CPU/wakeups ~0 between resyncs; single-append ingest p50 < 3s
  including debounce; 10k-file corpus single-append does not walk.

## 12. Rollout

1. **Phase 1 — hybrid skeleton**: add `notify` dep, `watch.rs` with roots +
   filter + debounce + dirty set, Tier 3 triggers only (events cause an early
   `ingest_all` instead of waiting for the sleep). Correct by construction
   (still full scans), proves watcher coverage and filtering. Ship behind
   `hybrid`.
2. **Phase 2 — Tier 1/2 fast paths**: constrain discovery by dirty set /
   affected root. Prove converge-equality (section 8 invariant) in CI soak.
3. **Phase 3 — default flip**: `hybrid` → `events` default, poll kept as
   `--watch-mode poll` escape hatch. Raise resync default from 30s toward
   5–15 min once field data shows overflows are rare.
4. **Phase 4 — cleanup**: only after a release of soak data; remove the sleep
   loop if unneeded, keep `poll` mode for exotic filesystems (NFS/SMB where
   inotify/FSEvents don't fire — document this: network mounts stay on poll).

## 13. Open decisions (resolve before Phase 2)

- `notify` version + which debouncer (`mini` preferred; confirm rename-cookie
  behavior for atomic-save editors on both platforms).
- Exact debounce/settle numbers from a 24h field soak on a large corpus.
- Whether `scan_cache.json` TTL logic (`can_skip_fresh_scan`) stays as a
  second-level guard — recommendation: keep, it protects search-time paths.
- Memory-docs watching stays out of v1 (section 5) — confirm no large-memory
  workflow depends on sub-minute memory freshness.
